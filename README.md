GreenLoop is a sustainable fashion platform that connects people who want to donate or consign their pre-loved clothes with those in need of affordable, quality fashion items.  

The project aims to reduce textile waste, promote a circular economy, and make clothing accessible to everyone through an online marketplace experience.

Users can easily donate clothes they no longer use, or consign items in good condition for resale.
